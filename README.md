# Automatic classification of articles (Unstructured data)
Creation of an automatic classification engine for 
<a href="https://www.flipkart.com/">Flipkart marketplace</a> 
items. </br>
The objective is to automatically determine the category of an item from an image and a description.

## Conduct of the feasibility study
1 - Description of the dataset
2 - Text mining and optimization (Tokenization, Stop Words, Stemming, TF-IDF)
3 - Implementation of a textual clustering (KMeans, LDA)
4 - Image exploration and optimization
5 - Implementation of an image clustering (SIFT, CNN transfer learning)
6 - Conclusion of the feasibility study
7 - Proposal for improvement

## Conclusion

We have 7 categories offered by Flipkart marketplace. 
We give a conclusion on the feasibility of classification for each category (for image clustering and text clustering)

## Proposal for improvement

• Modification of the main categories to make them more explicit (the notion of "Home furnishings" is very broad unlike "Watches") </br>

• Create a rich database based on the secondary categories (they are more explicit but unfortunately not enough data </br>

• First, set up a category suggestion engine before fully automating it " It seems that your item is in the " Sofas " category YES / NO </br>
